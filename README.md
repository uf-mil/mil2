# Software @ UF MIL <sup><i>(now in ROS2!)</i></sup>

Welcome to the repository for the software team of the Machine Intelligence Lab at the University of Florida, a robotics lab in Gainesville, Florida. Our lab has built [several robotic systems](https://mil.ufl.edu/projects/) since its inception several decades ago. Our current projects include:

* **SubjuGator AUV:** An autonomous, underwater submarine-like vehicle. Three-time champion of the AUVSI/ONR underwater competition. ([Website](https://subjugator.org))
* **NaviGator AMS:** An autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) which has competed in several maritime competitions. Won the 2016 Maritime RobotX Challenge, and received fourth in the 2018 Maritime RobotX Challenge. ([Website](https://subjugator.org))
* **InvestiGator UAV:** An unmanned aerial vehicle capable of completing aerial complex missions. Designed to be used in companion with NaviGator AMS, including being able to be launched and return to the marine vehicle.
* **Mission Red Rover:** A terrestrial rover project, capable of perceiving its environment and navigating complex environments.
* **Virtual RobotX:** An new extension of the NaviGator project supporting virtual robotics.

Our first meeting of the Fall 2021 season was recorded, and can be found [here](https://mil.ufl.edu/videos/MIL_Kick_Off_Fall_2021.mp4).
The meeting introduced MIL and featured a tour of our lab. It's a great introduction
to what we do; we encourage you to watch!

## Software

A lot of what can be found here is the software we use to control our robots.
We heavily use the robotic middleware ROS for the past few years. We have around
60 ROS packages currently in use on our robots, most of which can be found here.

Furthermore, we attempt to provide extensive testing, documentation, and continuous
integration for our software. We self-host our [documentation](https://mil.ufl.edu/docs/)
and use GitHub Actions as our CI provider.

If you're interested in some of the software we've written, we'd love to talk to
you. While we generally don't take contributions from those not currently at the
university (because of the amount of internal testing and tools used), we'd love
any other input you may have.

## Interested in joining?

If you're currently a student at the University of Florida or if you will be one soon,
we'd love to have you on our team. Please email our director, Dr. Eric Schwartz
(`ems <at> ufl.edu`), or visit our [website](https://mil.ufl.edu) for more information.

We aim to be a very inclusive environment where learning is emphasized; so please
do not feel that you need to be well-versed in computers or robotics before entering
our lab.
